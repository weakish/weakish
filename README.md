### Hi there 👋

This is the GitHub README of a vigorously lazy deadbeat with matured immaturity.

- 💬 Ask me about anything by sending a pull request to edit this README file.

- 😄 Pronouns: it/it.

- ⛓️ Fun fact:

    > `git symbolic-ref refs/heads/master refs/heads/main` — if you're uncomfortable in a modern repository with your oldschool habits :)
    > – [kolypto]

- 📝 I keep a weblog via git commit log.

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:weakish/weakish.git
    cd weakish
    git log
    ```
